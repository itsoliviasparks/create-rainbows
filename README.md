# One in a Vermillion ðŸŒˆ
A cute <em>punny</em> little web app that creates a rainbow based on user input.

## About
- An exercise in manipulating the DOM exclusively with vanilla JavaScript (jQuery Free Zone! ðŸš«)

## Features
- Utilizes JavaScript, CSS/SCSS, and HTML

## Development Process
- With a broad project brief, I always like to have a little fun!
- I've been curious about drawing with CSS, so I took this project as an opportunity to dip my toe, ever-so-slightly, in by drawing a simple rainbow

## Next Steps
- I was able to draw a semi-circle for each arch of the rainbow, but could not figure out how to cut out a smaller semi-circle on the flat edge to create an arch.
To solve, I've added an additional div with a background matching the total site.
Although the backgrounds do not line up perfectly, I don't think the visual is distracting.
- I would love to do more research into creating shapes in CSS to be able to successfully execute a true arch shape, and not beed the additional div for the centre of the semi-circle.
- The height of the site is set to 100vh.
On mobile this is causing an issue where the height is set to the total hight of the device screen, instead of accounting for the browser menu & the inner height.
Looking into correcting this for future.
